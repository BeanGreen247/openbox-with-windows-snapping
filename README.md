# openbox-with-windows-snapping
Patch to enable window snapping by dragging the window (aero snap) for openbox.

Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/BeanGreen247/openbox-with-windows-snapping
cd openbox-with-windows-snapping
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64
make
sudo make install
```
Multiple monitors kinda work, but it's buggy.
